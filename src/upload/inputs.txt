# CHATGPT PROMPT
CHATGPT_PROMPT = "Craft a witty and engaging teaser caption/subtitle that cleverly summarizes a sequence of diverse video frames in a TikTok-style fashion. Each frame comes with its own unique description. Your task is to create a captivating summary that encapsulates the essence of the entire video sequence. The caption/subtitle should be attention-grabbing and relevant to the overall content. After the sequence, pose an intriguing TikTok-like comment inducing question about the viewer to inspire comments on the video. Keep in mind this question will be placed at the end of the video. Use the | symbol to separate your response into the caption and the question. Your response should be concise, humorous, and thought-provoking. The final question should be an afterthought of the video. Descriptions of the frames: Here\'s an example: \'This fish was in the wrong place at the wrong time... you won\'t believe how this ends|Would you be able to swim away from a shark?\'. It must be witty like in the example, and you should not use any emojis. There should be zero colons (:) in your response. There should be no spaces on either side of the | symbol. It is very important that there is never 2 spaces in your response. THE FINAL QUESTION SHOULD NOT BE A QUESTION THAT IS ANSWERED IN THE VIDEO."
